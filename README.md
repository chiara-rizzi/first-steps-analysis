# First steps in the analysis
Instructions for the first steps needed to produce studies with the ntuples produced with FactoryTools

In this repo you can find 
* Information about the ntuples needed to get started with quark-gluon tagging 
* Description of the basic steps 

## Variables for Quark/Gluon Tagging 

## Event weights 
When producing histograms, the minimal set of weights to be considered are:
the MC weight 
This event is related to how the events are generated. 
The cross section weight. This number, which is the same for all events belonging to the same sample, is basically the ratio between the number of simulated MC events and the number of events that we expect to have in a certain amount of collected data, based on the cross section of the specific process. 

## Example code 

## Tasks
Plot the distribution of the number of
